ANALYSIS: Find a bike and Explore! 
 
No matter where you are in NY City you will always find a bike. But if you go to zipcode 10009 you will definitely find a bike. Check out the visualization of  Bike Locations “All bike stations of the most popular locations with zip code”. There are 710 bikes at 8Ave & W31st checkout the “Top 10 Stations”Visualization. 
  
If you are looking to join a lot of bikers and have an experience as a group you should go at 8AM “Peak Hours during the day” Visualization will help to determine that. Of course summer season will have the max number of bikers the visualization list 3000 at that time of the day in summer. Fall season has the second highest bikes but 8AM still seems to be the popular time of the day. 
  
“Ridership has growth by percentage” visualization shows The trends of count of bikes  % of Total Count of bikes along Month . Color shows details about count of bikes and % of Total Count of bikes along the Month. So Fall season the ridership increase as the month went by. 2019 fall has very good weather hence increase in ridership. 
  
Maximum bike male riders are 41 year old . That age group Trip duration they took was 2,389,248. Maximum female riders are of the age 32. That age group Trip duration they took was 700,552.  For the year 2019. You can look at “Trip Duration by age. 
  
There is not much benefit in advertizing to customers as all the months show very less customers compared to subscribers in the visualization “Subscriber vs Consumers for different month”
